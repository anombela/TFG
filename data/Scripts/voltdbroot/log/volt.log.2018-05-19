2018-05-19 07:26:31,145   INFO  [Estimated Time Updater] HOST: 37727475 estimated time update.
2018-05-19 08:06:26,611   ERROR [MpInitiator deliver] HOST: UniqueIdGenerator time moved backwards from: 1526717212673 to 1526717186575, a difference of 26,10 seconds.
Continuing operation by adding an offset of 26,10 to system time. This means the time and unique IDs provided by VoltProcedure  (getUniqueId, getTransactionId, getTransactionTime) will not correctly reflect wall clock time as reported by the system clock. For severe shifts you could see duplicate IDs or time moving backwards when the server is restarted causing the offset to be discarded.
2018-05-19 08:07:21,234   ERROR [MpInitiator deliver] HOST: Host clock seems to have adjusted again to make the offset unecessary
